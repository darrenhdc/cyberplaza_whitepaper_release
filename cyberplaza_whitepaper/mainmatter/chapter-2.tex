\chapter{Vision and Mission}
%\label{chapter:title}
\begin{itemize}
\item Computing is a powerful means to advance humanity.
\item The transformative potential of computing to advance humanity can be expedited through an open, inclusive and democratic Web 3 platform of computility.
\item Taobao and Pinduoduo excel as businesses ``for the people'', but they are not businesses ``of and by'' the people. A Web3 platform doing business on computility can be fully ``for, of and by'' the people.
\item The ideal business is a shared-vision DAO\footnote{DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization}, and the optimal DAO is a successful business.
\item Our mission is to serve thy kind\footnote{``Thy kind'' refers to humankind, emphasizing our commitment to serving all of humanity} by operating as a vision-driven DAO-business of computility.
